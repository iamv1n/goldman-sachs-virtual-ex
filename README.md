# Goldman Sachs Virtual Experience Program

This was an assignment given by goldman sachs where I had to crack and verify passwords given in the [passwd_dump.txt](https://github.com/iamv1n/goldman-sachs-virtual-ex/blob/main/passwd_dump.txt)  file by experimenting and using different cryptographic hashing algorithms and create a Report on the same.
